# Welcome to Mash's Pinnable Repl Donation & Link-in-Bio Page

In a few short steps you can create your very own donation page. See it live as a pinned REPL at _________

This Repl provides a canvas to create a link-in-bio page with new donation features built-in. Users can support you with one-click donations called Boosts (no credit cards every time), and one-time donations powered by Mash. 

They can also support you natively with other Bitcoin Lightning Network wallets with an LN-URL QR Code or Lightning Address (learn more at ) and also get links to your site and bio pages. Get started and discover the future of payments. Learn more at: https://www.getmash.com/news/bitcoin-lightning-address-and-qr-code

We make it easy for your users. When they visit your site or repl, they'll get access to their funds in their Mash Wallet. Alternatively, they can create an account and get funds immediately to support you by buying a wallet, or scan the QR code with another supporting wallet. 

## Get Started
1. Fork this REPL (you know this!)

2. Get donations sorted on your site by creating an account sorted at wallet.getmash.com/earn – make sure to choose a fun handle!

3. Update your EarnerID in this REPL to ensure that you get donations directly – specifically in main.jsx file
    * const earnerId = "**686c1f12-7995-4399-87a2-d6d8630f1417**";

4. Update the links to your social pages in main.jsx. Alternatively you can remove each button by un-commenting the lines at the bottom of main.jsx (deleting '//' at the beginning of each line) - or make your own custom one! (e.g., repl overview).
   
5. Take a look at your Mash Page that was created with your Mash account – it's available at https://wallet.getmash.com/e/yourhandle (replace your handle with the one you selected)
6. Go to your profile page and Pin this REPL there and ask users to support you.
7. Share this repl URL with users that you want to get support from – optionally create  and connect a custom domain.


# This REPL uses Vite ⚡

> Next Generation Frontend Tooling

- 💡 Instant Server Start
- ⚡️ Lightning Fast HMR
- 🛠️ Rich Features
- 📦 Optimized Build
- 🔩 Universal Plugin Interface
- 🔑 Fully Typed APIs

Vite (French word for "fast", pronounced `/vit/`) is a new breed of frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that serves your source files over [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), with [rich built-in features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html) and astonishingly fast [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).

- A [build command](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) that bundles your code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

In addition, Vite is highly extensible via its [Plugin API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) and [JavaScript API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html) with full typing support.
